NOTES TO REMEMBER
 1. Send as little information as possible from class to class.
 2. Your focus here is not Ruby, it's TDD and using Git.
 3. Consider your initialize class (given you're doing TDD)

PSUEDOCODE FOR THE GAME
 0. Initialize your game.rb
    # cage = nil
    # player1
    # player2
    # current_player
 1. Create the players lets go with 2 players, and no computer
    # I think I should go basic player1 = create_player, player2 = create_player
    # NEEDS to have: 1) name, 2) token. Both should be visible to game.rb
    # I would like tokens to be circle-white and circle-black from here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters#Miscellaneous_Symbols
    # to display blank cells, it would be cool to just have a similarly-sized blank circle (search for 'Large circle' -- that should work well)
 2. Build the cage.rb.
    # I would like the size of the board to be from player_input
    # I think it should be stored as an array. It is inherently just rows x columns
    # NEEDS method cage.show. I think I can just cage_arr.each ( puts cell ). Note
